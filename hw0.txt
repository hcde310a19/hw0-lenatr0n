# Description of your program (part 7)

To count the number of words in a document, I would first have a counter that starts at 0.
I would then read through the document, and the counter will add 1 to its current count whenever there is a space between a character,
or if there is a period, exclamation point, or question mark attached to the end of a character.

For example in this sentence:

Hello, my name is Lena Tran.

I would have my counter start at 0. Then, the space between Hello, and my would add 1 to the counter. The counter would now be 1.
Then, it would count the spaces in between all the other words and the total count would be 5. Then, since Tran. ends in a period it would add
1 more to the total count of 5, giving a total of 6 words.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

This previous exercise was actually pretty difficult to me. At first I didn't know if I wanted to write the description in steps
or if I wanted to just write it in sentences. Then, I had a hard time because of the specs because I didn't really know what constitutes as
a word. For example, would a word with a hyphen count as one or two words? So I then went on google docs and see how they counted words,
and just followed the rules they used. Another problem I ran into was if sentences didn't end with periods. So an example would be:
"hello world"
My counter would only count this as 1 word because it didn't end with a period. I wrote the description of my counter under the assumption
that the word documents would use full and complete sentences. I am unsure how to address this issue of incomplete sentences.
The satisfying thing about trying to describe these instructions in english is that it gives me a better idea of how I might actually
have to code it if I were to make a computer program. The unsatisfying thing is having to deal with any oddballs.

I hope to become a better coder through this course. I want to be able to think more logically and critically when it comes to coding.
Coding is something that I really struggle with, so I hope that I can learn the skills to confidently code by myself. In addition,
I want to learn how to be able to read code and understand what it is saying.
